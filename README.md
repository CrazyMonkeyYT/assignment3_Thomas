# assign3 Implements an AVL tree



## Purpose
Implement an AVL tree using the algorithm presented in the Lewis *et al.* textbook. 

## Specification

The following is a description of the classes:

- <code>BTNodeInt.java</code>: binary tree node interface
- <code>TreeNode.java</code>: implementation class for a binary tree node
- <code>Tree.java</code>: TreeADT interface
- <code>BinarySearchTree.java</code>: implementation class for a binary tree
- <code>BTView.java</code>: class responsible for drawing a binary search tree on a JavaFX Pane
- <code>Main.java</code>: application class that display a window that allows the user to input nodes and delete nodes

**Action items**

1. Please implement the following classes:

    - <code>AVLTreeNode.java</code>: implementation class for an AVL tree node
    - <code>AVLTree.java</code>: implementation class for an AVL tree
    - <code>AVLTView.java</code>: class responsible for drawing an AVL tree on a JavaFXPane.  The tree node MUST display the balance factor.

2. Please modify Main.java so that it will display an AVL tree instead of a general binary search tree.  Please note, when adding/deleting node from an AVL tree, it must try to balance itself.
